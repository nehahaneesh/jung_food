  <section class="gallery">
    <img src="Fries.JPG" alt="Fries" /><h2 style="color: bisque;">FRIES</h2><p style="color:blue" align="right">French fries are generally considered junk food due to their high calorie and fat content, often associated with increased risk of health problems like heart disease and obesity.</br> While potatoes themselves are nutritious, the deep-fried preparation and high-fat cooking methods make them a less healthy option. </p></br>
    <img src="pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza" /><h2 style="color:antiquewhite">PIZZA</h2><p style="color:blue" align="right">Pizza is often considered a junk food due to its high calorie, sodium, and fat content, particularly when it comes to fast-food or commercially prepared options.</br> While it can be a balanced meal with healthy ingredients, it often lacks nutritional value and can contribute to negative health outcomes if consumed regularly. 
</p></br>
    <img src="burger.jpg" alt="Burger" /><h2 style="color:beige">BURGER</h2><p style="color:blue" align="right">Burgers can be considered junk food depending on their ingredients and preparation methods, especially if they are high in saturated fat, sodium, and calories. Fast-food burgers, often paired with fries and sugary drinks, are generally considered less nutritious than homemade options.</br> However, homemade burgers can be a healthier choice if prepared with lean meats, whole-grain buns, and plenty of vegetables. </br>
Why Burgers are Sometimes Considered Junk Food:</br>
High in Saturated Fat and Cholesterol:</br>
Fast-food burgers, especially those with beef patties, tend to be high in saturated fat and cholesterol.</br> 
Excessive Sodium:</br>
Many fast-food burgers are loaded with sodium from ingredients like cheese, sauces, and preservatives.</br> 
High Calorie Count:</br>
The combination of meat, cheese, sauces, and buns can result in a high-calorie burger. </br>
Lack of Nutrients:</br>
While burgers provide protein, they may lack essential vitamins and minerals found in whole foods. </br>
